 Question 01   A brief introduction to the repository.
 
 ans   
 A repository is a storage location where code, files, and other resources related to a project are kept. It helps organize and manage all the components of a project, making it easy to track changes, collaborate with others, and maintain different versions of the project over time.

Repositories are commonly used in version control systems like Git, where they store not only the project's files but also a history of changes made to those files. This allows developers to work on projects together, keep track of who made what changes, and roll back to previous versions if needed.

Repositories can be hosted online on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, making them accessible to anyone with the right permissions, which is particularly useful for open-source projects or team collaborations.
